### The Juice:

If my early educational choices were a D&D character, he'd be the idiot who spend all his XP on cross-class skills. I enjoy a colorful array of them, including [sports writing](https://lawlessrepublic.com/author/aandreason/), public speaking, and saying off-the-cuff puns. I have a so-so jump hook, but rebound like a jerk.

There's a lot of good ways to code out there. Right now I'm focusing on JavaScript, enjoying the twists of Node.js and React, and I might just be a huge [Svelte](https://svelte.dev/) fan. üòç I also have done good work in MongoDB/Express APIs, have danced once or twice with GraphQL/Prisma servers.

I like working with client logic, building cool tools, and forEach methods. Lover of cheese, anime, BYU sports, and games.
