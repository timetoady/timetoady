### The Juice:

If my early educational choices were a D&D character, he'd be the idiot who spend all his XP on cross-class skills. I enjoy a colorful array of them, including [sports writing](https://lawlessrepublic.com/author/aandreason/), public speaking, and saying off-the-cuff puns. I have a so-so jump hook, but rebound like a jerk.

There's a lot of good ways to code out there. Right now I'm focusing on JavaScript, enjoying the reaches of Node.js and React. I like working with logic, building cool tools, and forEach methods.
